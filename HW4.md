Part 1
------

I first look to run Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the data. The
goal of PCA here is to find low-dimensional summaries that will allow us
to further understand the dataset.

Here I look to visualize the first 3 PCA components and attempt to see
whether there are groupings in wine color or wine quality.
