Abstract
========

In this report, I summarize the overall trends of the 3-point attempts
starting from 1980 to 2017.

Introduction
============

In today's age of basketball, we've all heard of the names of prolific
3-point shooters such as Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, and James Harden,
and the wave of 3-point shooting that has accompanied them. Harden in
particular has been indoctrinated into a system revolving around this
shot. The Houston Rockets, a home town favorite of mine, are notorious
around the league for pushing the envelope of this new 3-point movement,
in which they have dropped the midrange 2-point shot from their
repertoire in favor of the more efficient 3-point shot.

Teams have not alwasy been so reliant on this particular shot or even
had the opportunity for it. Surprising to many, the 3-point shot was
only introduced to the NBA in the 1979 season, and other governing
basketball bodies such as FIBA, Olypmics, and NCAA followed suit in the
next few years. The NBA since then has tried to tinker with the distance
of the shot to increase and decrease scoring, but today it is at the
original 23 feet and 9 inches around the arc while being 22 ft. from the
corners.

But where will all this lead? Has the likes of Steph Curry and James
Harden ushered in a new era of basketball dependent on the 3-point shot?
Here we will examine this increase in volume of 3-point shots using
other advanced basketball metrics.

Methodology
===========

The data set used here was obtained through Kaggle, but it is a
aggregated dataset of players from 1950-2017 scraped from
basketball-reference.com. The data includes the typical box-score stats
such as points, assists, and rebounds to advanced features such as PER
and true shooting percentages.

For my purposes, I begin by subsetting the data by years after 1979
where the NBA introduced the 3-point line. From their I look into other
correlation and trends that may be interesting. Herem I start with teams
and years and then move towards basketball metrics. \# Results
